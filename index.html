						<li><h5>UBS: Transformation Capability</h5></li>
						<p>I currently manage a small team delivering a transformation capability, homogenising a variety of flow into UBS across FIX, SWIFT, and file amongst other formats, into UBS native message structures (and vice versa).</p>
						<li><h5>Tesco: Enterprise Search</h5></li>
						<p>I contributed to the Enterprise Search platform at Tesco, surfacing products across the Tesco estate. I mainly worked on data ingestion and infrastructure, delivering Java 8 applications on distributed cloud platforms.</p>
						<li><h5>Rightmove: Data Services</h5></li>
						<p>I worked within the Data Services space at Rightmove, on the stack of products servicing the property science and valuation area. I developed RESTful Microservices in Java 11 and Python 3, and implemented front-ends in AngularJS and React.</p>
						<li><h5>ION: FX Technology</h5></li>
						<p>I worked on a large-scale, multi-year FX re-engineering project. The aim was the delivery of multiple post-trade applications, using a service-oriented architecture.</p>
						<li><h5>RBS: Futures Execution & Clearing Technology</h5></li>
						<p>I have worked within the Futures Technology space at RBS, managing the in-house Execution/Clearing middleware platform. The technology used client/server Java methodologies, and required knowledge of the FIX Protocol. I completed a large transformation project for a vendor switch during my tenure. I additionally worked on the decommission and rewrite of mass legacy code.</p>
						<li><h5>CMMI & Agile Methodologies</h5></li>
						<p>I have worked on enhancing existing Agile practices within my team, implementing Agile methodologies with Scrum and Kanban techniques, whilst using technologies such as JIRA, Confluence, Stash, Github and Gitlab.  Additionally, I introduced a Continuous Maturity Model Integration to my team in order to further add to our productivity. I am keen to continue this kind of work in the future.</p>
						<li><h5>Continuous Integration</h5></li>
